    A zookeeper connection can experience transient connection failures
    on any operation. As long as the session associated to the connection
    is still active on the zookeeper cluster, libzookeeper can reconnect
    automatically to the cluster and session and the client is able to
    retry.

    Whether a given operation is safe for retry depends on the application
    in question and how's interacting with zookeeper.

    In particular coordination around sequence nodes can be
    problematic, as the client has no way of knowing if the operation
    succeed or not without additional application specific context.

    Idempotent operations against the zookeeper tree are generally
    safe to retry.

    This class provides a simple wrapper around a zookeeper client,
    that will automatically perform retries on operations that
    interact with the zookeeper tree, in the face of transient errors,
    till the session timeout has been reached. All of the attributes
    and methods of a zookeeper client are exposed.

    All the methods of the client that interact with the zookeeper tree
