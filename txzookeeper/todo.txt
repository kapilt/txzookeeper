bugs to file upstream

 - you can set acl on a non existant node.
 - memory leak every api invocation. [really? need some measurements here]

 observed while trying xtest_get_children_with_watcher

 - async get children with watcher seems broken. [772 - fixed upstream]
 - segfault if close during completion.
 - getting a watch notification when closing a connection, segfaults.
